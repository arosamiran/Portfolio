					<h3>Designs</h3>
					<h3 style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: 20px">Shirts</h3>
					<div id="imageHolder-shirts">
						<table>
							<tr>
								<td><img src="the-black-mamba.jpg" alt="The Black Mamba"><figcaption>The Black Mamba</figcaption></td>
								<td><img src="pizza-is-life.jpg" alt="Pizza is Life"><figcaption>Pizza is Life</figcaption></td>

					<p>I submitted these designs as entries in a contest for the Programmers, Developers group in Facebook sometime in March. Unfortunately I didn't win but that's okay. I entered for the experience like when I volunteered for the Maker Festival Manila in 2014 hosted by Mozilla.</p>
					<h3 style="text-decoration: none; margin-left: 20px">The Logo</h3>
					<div id="imageHolder-right"><img src="logo-beta.jpg" alt="Drawing of the logo" id="beta"><figcaption>Drawing of the logo</figcaption></div>
					<p>On the right is a scanned-copy of the logo when it is being conceived. I don't know where is the hard copy of it - I must've lost it. I don't know when I made it either but checking the exif file of the photo, I last modified it two years ago (April 11, 2014 to be exact)</p>
					<p>And below are the final versions of the logo. The first one, I use it for beta versions of things I'm working on. The second one, for final or release versions. I get inspiration from Caspar Lee's logo. He's a video blogger (vlogger) based in London but he's really from South Africa. You can follow his channel <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

					<h4>Why "Doodlr"?</h4>
					<p>Doodlr is the term I use to call my works. I mean, like a name of the company that my works came from. It's like a personal brand of sorts. I also call my blogs Doodlr.</p>
					<p>Doodlr - also because I have this personal rule that my works came from the mind and the first thing I do to take them out is scribble or make a doodle.</p>
	
					<h3>Animations</h3>
					<h4>The VSA logo</h4>
					<p>This thing is really new to me. Here are some of my works anyways.</p>
					<div id="imageHolder-animation" style="float: right;">
						<table>
							<tr>
								<td>
									<img src="vsa-logo.gif" alt="VSA logo animation" id="vsa">
								</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
					</div>
					<p>I am a member of a volunteer organization at our school named the Volunteer Student Assistant. This group is composed of computer engineering students doing voluntary works like repairing personal computers. Yeah I like voluntary works.</p>
					<p>Aside from that, we also participate in voluntary activities outside the school - like the event by Mozilla.</p>
					<p>We also maintain a computer laboratory in our school, keeping the networks in check and also making sure that every computer is working - ready to be used by a student during class-hour.</p>
					<p>You can visit our website (yes, we have a website) <a href="#">here</a> and also like our Facebook Page <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

					<h4>Battery animation</h4>
					<div id="imageHolder-animation">
						<table style="float: left;">
							<tr>
								<td>
									<img src="battery-animation.gif" alt="VSA logo animation" style="margin-right: 20px; width: 216px;">
								</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
					</div>

					<p>This is the first animation I made after I attended a seminar about Photoshop last September 2015.</p>
