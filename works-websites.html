			<h3>A little trip down memory lane</h3>
			<p>I remember back when I was in high school (I think that's my 2nd year), we have a computer-related subject. At one time we have this topic on databases where we'll have to make SQL queries described by our teacher. Yes, described because he'll just describe to us what he wants to happen then we'll have to code the queries. By that time we have no idea what we are actually doing. It is just now that I went to college that I realized we were actually doing some sort of Database Management System (DBMS). I was one of the top performing students by that time. (I'm really enjoying what I was doing!)</p>
			<p>Then there's this topic where we'll have to make a website - with a picture of our classmates. I have already forgotten what I did that time but I remember that picture should be clickable and the user will be lead to another page that will serve as our classmate's profile page. I can't remember the software we used that time, what I remember is that it features a drag-and-drop interface.</p>
			<p>These two experiences molded my passion in programming. Now, let's have a look at some of my works.</p>
			<h4>My works</h4>
			<p>Ok, let me tell you this early on that the following are just screenshots. I'm still working on having them to be viewable in this frame.</p>

			<p>I am sorry, this page is still under construction. I will update it as soon as possible.</p>
