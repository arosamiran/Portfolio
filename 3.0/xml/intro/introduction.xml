        <text>Hello! I am Angelo Rosamiran, a Computer Engineering student.</text>
        <text>Aside from what I am learning in school, I am also passionate about programming - especially on the web development and designing front.</text>
        <text>In my free-time I read e-books about web-development and go through the exercises by creating websites (like this) to test my understanding. I also do designs (lanyards and shirts).</text>
